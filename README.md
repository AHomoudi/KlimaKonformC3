The goal of KlimaKonformC3 is to analyse the Agricultural Simulations performed within of the Projekt KlimaKonform (TB C3 Landwirtschaft)

## Installation

`KlimaKonformC3` is NOT available from CRAN, so you can NOT use `install.packages("KlimaKonformC3")`.

You can install the development version of KlimaKonformC3 like so:

``` r
# Intsalling KlimaKonfromC3
devtools::install_github("ahmathlete/KlimaKonformC3")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:
Two types of functions are included in the package: 
1. `sim` functions: they are mainly written to perform analysis on individual simulation files/file. 
2. `ens` functions: they are mainly written to perform analysis on ensemble files/file. 

``` r
library(KlimaKonformC3)
## basic example code
```
